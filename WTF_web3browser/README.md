## 🏗️ Architecture
**How does your product work?**
1. **Identity Handshake**: Users are greeted with a "Wallet Gatekeeper" modal to authenticate via their Web3 wallet. 
2. **The Workspace**: Users gain access to a customized, desktop-like immersive interface containing DApps, Rewards, WTF Zone (Games), Education, and Security tabs.
3. **Immersive Browsing**: The explore section acts as a search engine. When a user opens a DApp, it loads seamlessly within the browser workspace using iframe neural link technology.
4. **Economic Engine**: As users browse and read articles, the frontend communicates with the backend to record points, which can be redeemed on-chain.

**What components are involved?**
The frontend is a highly interactive Single Page Application built using **React** and **Vite**.
- **`components/`**: Modular UI elements like the Wallet Gatekeeper, DApp Viewer, and Security Dashboards.
- **Neural Guard**: The active security layer blocking ads and trackers on decentralized websites.
- **Python Backend Engine**: An external service validating gamification metrics and managing the DApp directory.

## 🔗 HeLa Integration
**How is your dApp leveraging the HeLa Network?**
The platform is natively built for the **Hela Network**. The browser tracks user educational and browsing metrics as "Sync" points. When a user accumulates enough points, the frontend interacts directly with our deployed smart contract on the Hela Testnet to distribute **HLUSD** rewards to their connected wallet, showcasing the speed and efficiency of Hela transactions.

### Deployed Contract Details (Hela Testnet)
- **Token / Contract Address**: `0xBE75FDe9DeDe700635E3dDBe7e29b5db1A76C125`

**Proof of Transactions (Tx Hashes):**
